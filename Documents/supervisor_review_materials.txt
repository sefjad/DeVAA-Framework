Meeting: Saturday, 16 August 2025, 13:00 (German time)

Goals for this review
- Demonstrate compiled thesis structure aligned to the Dissertation Module Handbook
- Show MVP feasibility: contracts, ZKP circuit, metrics, and architecture
- Get guidance on scope for final polish (theory vs MVP depth)

What we completed since last meeting
- Thesis: 6 chapters + TOC/LoF/LoT + references (73 pages, BibTeX resolved)
- Architecture: Four-layer model with sequence and data flow diagrams
- Blockchain: AgentRegistry, JobBoard with tests; gas optimization documented
- ZKP: Circom sentiment circuit; integration path documented
- Evaluation: Gas, cost, latency tables; methodology and metrics defined
- Ethics: Correct dates (Apr–Sep 2025) and student numbers (GH1026457, GH1026144)

Key results (evidence)
- Gas reduction: 245k → 165,432 (−32.7%) with storage/event optimizations
- Measured latency under realistic Sepolia conditions; defined cost model (EIP-1559)
- End-to-end flow finalized: job posting → proof → verification → settlement

Remaining work to finish to submission quality
- Add final figures (architecture/dataflow/ZKP) as PNGs (no TikZ)
- Expand evaluation discussion and limitations; tighten contributions mapping
- Sweep for any placeholder phrasing and ensure consistent “We” tone

Risks/mitigations
- Time: Prioritize evaluation depth over new features; use L2 projections rather than building L2
- Citations: Completed BibTeX; final pass to ensure all are cited in-text

Questions for feedback
1) Prioritize depth in Evaluation (cost/latency) vs. expanding Related Work further?
2) Is current DSR framing sufficient, or should we add a formal method validation subsection?
3) Are three figures (architecture, data flow, ZKP path) sufficient for clarity?

Next milestones
- Insert PNG figures, expand evaluation/limitations, final compile
- Supervisor feedback integration and submission prep
