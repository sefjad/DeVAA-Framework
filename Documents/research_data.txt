# Research Data Index 

# Datasets (local-only, not committed)
- receipts.csv: exported transaction receipts for lifecycle runs (local path, not published)
- events.csv: exported contract events for lifecycle runs (local path, not published)
- gas_costs_eur.csv: ETH/EUR conversions used in figures (local path, not published)

# Environment
- OS: Windows 10
- Node: LTS (TODO: record exact `node -v`)
- npm: 10.9.0
- Networks: Sepolia (testnet)
- RPC: SEPOLIA_RPC_URL 
- Private key: PRIVATE_KEY 

# Toolchain Versions
- Hardhat: see app/blockchain/package.json
- Ethers: via hardhat-toolbox
- Circom/snarkjs: see app/zkp/package.json (snarkjs ^0.7.5)

# Contract Artifacts (addresses by network)
- deployments/sepolia.json (TODO: add file and addresses)
- deployments/localhost.json (optional)

# Reproducibility Notes
- Record base fee and priority tip for each run
- Keep ETH/EUR rate snapshots for cost conversion
- Use `node scripts/cli.js ... --no-wait` when only submission time is needed
- Save `txReceipt.json` and emitted events per lifecycle
