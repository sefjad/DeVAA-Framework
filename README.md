### Abstract
DeVAA presents a novel framework for enabling trustless coordination between AI service requesters and providers through blockchain technology and cryptographic proofs. The project implements smart contracts for marketplace coordination, zero-knowledge proof circuits for verifiable computation, and provides comprehensive performance analysis.

### Project Structure
- `/app` - Application implementation (smart contracts, ZKP circuits)
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Detailed directory structure

### Key Achievements
- ✅ Working smart contracts with 100% test coverage
- ✅ ZKP circuit implementation for verifiable computation
- ✅ Quantitative performance evaluation
- ⏳ Frontend and agent implementation planned

### Quick Start
```bash
# Smart contract testing
cd app/blockchain
npm install
npm test

```

### Research Type
Development-Based Research with Applied Research elements, following Design Science Research methodology.
